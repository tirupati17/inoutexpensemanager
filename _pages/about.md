Hello! I'm Tirupati Balan, the person who made the InOut Expense Manager app. Let me tell you why I made this app.

Before I made InOut Expense Manager, I used many other expense tracking apps. They were good, but all of them had one problem - I had to enter my regular expenses by hand every time. This was boring and took a lot of time.

That's when I got an idea: To create an app that doesn't need manual entry? No, I wanted to make an app that asks about your regular expenses when you start it for the first time, and then keeps track of them for you. And not just that, I wanted to avoid charging for features that don't cost me anything, like syncing with iCloud, subscription and ads etc.

The goal was to make a simple app to keep track of your money. In Android, it is easy to get messages about your spending and add them to the app automatically. But Apple does not allow this because of privacy. So, I had to find other ways to automate this process.

I'm not a financial expert or a tech whiz. I'm just a normal person who wanted to make managing money easier. I use InOut Expense Manager myself and keep making it better based on what I learn and the feedback I get.

I believe that the best solutions come from real-life problems. This app is not just something I made - it's something I use every day, and I hope it will help you as much as it helps me.

Are you ready to make managing your money easier? Let's get started!
