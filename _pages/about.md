## Security and Data Privacy

In an era where data security is paramount, Amigo - AI is built from the ground up with your privacy and security in focus. Here's how we ensure your financial information remains protected and confidential:

![Amigo - AI](icloud.png)
### Secure Data Backup with iCloud

Amigo - AI leverages iCloud for secure data backup, ensuring that your financial data is not only safe but also easily recoverable in case of device loss or damage. By utilizing Apple's built-in security mechanisms, we provide a robust solution for data storage without relying on third-party servers. Your data is encrypted end-to-end, meaning only you can access your information.

#### Data Storage and Privacy
When you use Amigo - AI, your financial data is stored directly in your own iCloud storage. This storage is part of a secure container that is managed by CloudKit, which allows us to structure the data without accessing the content itself.

- **Data Containers**: We use CloudKit containers to hold user data. These containers are designed so that data stored within them is accessible only by the intended iCloud user. Even as developers, we only interact with the schema and metadata — the structure of the data, not the data itself.
  
- **Privacy and Access Control**: Only you, the user, have the key to decrypt and access your data. Our servers, while responsible for managing the database schema and ensuring that the app functions smoothly, do not have access to decrypt your data.

- **Administrative Oversight**: From an administrative perspective, we can monitor the number of records for maintenance and performance optimization but cannot see the content of these records. This approach ensures that your financial information remains private and secure.

This iCloud-based solution not only enhances security by leveraging Apple's encryption but also respects user privacy by ensuring that data access is strictly controlled.


### AIProxy for Secure OpenAI Requests
Amigo - AI uses a third-party service called AIProxy from AIProxy.pro to handle secure interactions with OpenAI. Here’s how it helps keep your data safe:

- **Secure Communication**: AIProxy acts as a middleman between Amigo - AI and OpenAI, making sure that all data sent and received is secure.
- **Data Anonymization**: Before sending your data to OpenAI for processing, AIProxy removes any personal details that could identify you. This means only anonymous data is processed, keeping your personal information safe.
- **Split Key Security**: The key needed to talk to OpenAI is split into two parts. One part is kept safe on AIProxy, and the other is with you. When needed, these parts are combined just for the time needed to make a request, and then separated again. This keeps the full key secure.
- **Encryption**: All data sent through AIProxy is encrypted, which means it’s turned into a code that only authorized parties can decode. This protects your data from hackers.
- **No Permanent Data Storage**: AIProxy does not store your personal data once the request is completed. This minimizes the risk of your data being exposed or misused.


### Commitment to Privacy
Amigo - AI is committed to maintaining the highest standards of data privacy:
- **No Personal Data on Servers**: We do not store your personal financial data on any servers. All data is stored locally on your device and backed up to iCloud under your control.
- **Transparent Privacy Practices**: Our privacy policy is clear and straightforward, detailing how we handle your information without complicated jargon.
- **User-Centric Control**: You have complete control over your financial data. From data entry to data deletion, your privacy preferences are respected at every step.

With Amigo - AI, rest assured that your financial data is handled with the utmost care, ensuring privacy, security, and reliability. We make it our mission to provide a safe environment for you to manage your finances without compromise.

<!-- Hello! I'm Tirupati Balan, the person who made the Amigo AI app. Let me tell you why I made this app.

Before I made Amigo AI, I used many other expense tracking apps. They were good, but all of them had one problem - I had to enter my regular expenses by hand every time. This was boring and took a lot of time.

That's when I got an idea: To create an app that doesn't need manual entry? No, I wanted to make an app that asks about your regular expenses when you start it for the first time, and then keeps track of them for you. And not just that, I wanted to avoid charging for features that don't cost me anything, like syncing with iCloud, subscription and ads etc.

The goal was to make a simple app to keep track of your money. In Android, it is easy to get messages about your spending and add them to the app automatically. But Apple does not allow this because of privacy. So, I had to find other ways to automate this process.

I'm not a financial expert or a tech whiz. I'm just a normal person who wanted to make managing money easier. I use Amigo AI myself and keep making it better based on what I learn and the feedback I get.

I believe that the best solutions come from real-life problems. This app is not just something I made - it's something I use every day, and I hope it will help you as much as it helps me.

Are you ready to make managing your money easier? Let's get started! -->
